This repository contains R scripts that organize, analyze, and plot data from the long term Warming X Trophic Interactions experiment at Kellogg Biological Station and University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS).

The experiment began in June 2015 and at each site includes the following treatments:

2015-2017: warming (via open top chambers), herbivore access (via insecticide, small mammal exclosures)

2018: warming (via open top chambers), herbivore access (via insecticide)

In 2018 we removed the small mammal exclosures as they did not affect any of the plant response variables.

The total number of replicates is 6 at each site, excluding the small mammal treatment.


Response variables include:

Phenology: greenup

Phenology: flowering

Phenology: seed set

Community composition: percent cover

Herbivory: percent of plant species eaten at end of summer

Biomass (computed from relationship between community composition and biomass of similar plots outside experiment)

In 2017 we added C&N composition from plant leaves for a few species.

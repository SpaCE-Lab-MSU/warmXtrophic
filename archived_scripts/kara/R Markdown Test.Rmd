# Climate Data
Here's some code for a simple graph from my climate project. This graph was used to show a reviewer a single city wasn't driving the climate trends for a given region (coastal or inland). Not the prettiest graph, but it served its purpose.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
frost <- read.csv("AllCombined.csv", header = T)

ggplot(frost, aes(x = Year, y = as.Date(First, origin="1900-01-01"))) +
  geom_point(aes(col = City),alpha=1/5,size = 1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(col = City, linetype = Proximity), size = 1.2,
              fill = "grey95") +
  theme(axis.title.x=element_text(face = "bold"),
        axis.title.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
        legend.position = "right") +
  labs(y = "First Frost Date")
```

## This file reads in PDFs from a Scopus Search of papers containing "climate change" 
## and similar terms. It then analyzes the PDFs for their content, specifically
## if they contain mention of open top chambers.
## The full search is this:
## SCOPUS Search using following “Article Title, Abstract, Keywords” separated by “OR”
## “climate change”
## “climate-change”
## “climate warm*”
## “climate-warm*”
## “global change”
## “global-change”
## “global warm*”
## “global-warm*”
## “global-climate-change”
## “global-climate-warm*”
## “ITEX”
## AND “experiment”

# clear all existing data
rm(list=ls())

# close graphics devices
graphics.off()

# set working directory to where the PDFs are stored

# load packages

library(pdftools)

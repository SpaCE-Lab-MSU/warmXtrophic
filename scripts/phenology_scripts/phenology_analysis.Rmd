## UMBS Data

First Flower
```{r}

Models!
What is the effect of warming (state) on the median date of flower?
```{r}
# Models using median flowering julian date

# Null model?
model0 <- lmer(sqrt_julian ~ 1 # This means median flower date (julian) is predicted by the intercept
               + (1|plot), data = umbs_flwr_med, REML=FALSE) # each plot gets its own intercept?
summary(model0) 

# The effects of warming/ambient (state) on median date of flowering (julian) with species (species) as a random effect.
model1 <- lmer(sqrt_julian ~ state + (1|species), data = umbs_flwr_med, REML=FALSE)
summary(model1)

# The effects of warming/ambient on median date of flowering (julian - response variable) with an interaction between warming and native vs exotic species (origin) with species and year as a random effect.
model2 <- lmer(sqrt_julian ~ state*origin + (1|species) + (1|year_factor), data = umbs_flwr_med, REML=FALSE)
summary(model2)

# The effects of warming/ambient on median date of flowering with origin and insecticide as fixed effects and species and year_factor as random effects
model3 <- lmer(sqrt_julian ~ state + origin + insecticide + (1|species) + (1|year_factor), data = umbs_flwr_med, REML=FALSE)
summary(model3)
summ(model3)

Permanova
```{r}
#perma1 <- adonis2(julian ~ state + (1|species), data = umbs_flwr_med, permutations = 999, by = "terms")
#summary(perma1)

permanova.lmer(model1)
```

Updated from Kileigh's script
```{r, warning=FALSE}
#should plot be a random effect?
moda <- lmer(sqrt_julian ~ state*origin + insecticide + (1|species) + (1|plot), umbs_flwr_med, REML=FALSE)
mod1 <- lmer(sqrt_julian ~ state*origin + insecticide + (1|species), umbs_flwr_med, REML=FALSE)
anova(mod1,moda)
AIC(mod1, moda)

#Do we need insects?
mod2 <- lmer(sqrt_julian ~ state*origin + (1|species), umbs_flwr_med, REML=FALSE)
anova(mod2,mod1)

#Do we need interaction term?
mod3 <- lmer(sqrt_julian ~ state + origin + (1|species), umbs_flwr_med, REML=FALSE)

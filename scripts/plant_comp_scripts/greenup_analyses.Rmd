COLLABORATORS:  Moriah Young, Mark Hammond, Pat Bills  
DATA INPUT:     Data imported as csv files from shared Google drive "SpaCE_Lab_warmXtrophic" plant comp folder  
DATA OUTPUT:    a brief description of the data output from through the script, including what format itâ€™s in
OVERVIEW:       This script explores and analyses the greenup data from the KBS and UMBS stations. Greenup was recorded as percent cover of each species in each plot every 3 days in the beginning of the field season. Percent cover continued to be measured until the end of the field season. For calculating greenup dates, we use the date at which 50% of a species maximum percent cover was reached for each plot, to account for variation in litter depth affecting the early season's first greenup date.
REQUIRES:       Kara: elaborate on this to include any scripts or code sources that are required:                    Prior to running this script, run plant_comp_clean_L0.R, which creates greenup.csv ...
NOTES: 
The green_kbs and green_umbs dataframes contain data for greenup at each site.  
"half_cover_date" is the date at which 50% of a species max cover was reached (per plot, per year)  
"state" describes each treatment - warmed or ambient
